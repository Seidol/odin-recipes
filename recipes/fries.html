    <h1>McDonald’s fries</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make the meal addition, the restaurant revealed in a 2015 video that they use non-GMO potatoes, including shepody, ranger russet, Umatilla russet and russet Burbank varieties.
        </p>
        <p>After peeling the potatoes and cutting them into uniform thin slices, the fries are dipped into water to remove “excess natural sugars for colour reasons” and then bathed in an “ingredient bath” of dextrose and sodium acid pyrophosphate.</p>
    <H3>Ingredients</H3>

        <li>
            Sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            3 russet potatoes
        </li>
        <li>
            Oil

        Steps
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add sugar to a bowl of water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then, you have to cut the potatoes into slices.
        </li>
        <li>
            place the slices into the sugar water and place them in the fridge for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the fries are dry and the oil is hot enough, you place them into the pan and flash-fry them for 60 seconds, before placing them in a pan and putting them back into the fridge for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            refry the slices for four to five minutes until they are “golden brown” before placing them in a big bowl and sprinkling them with salt.
        </li>
    </ol>
